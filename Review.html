              <p>This class was excellent--where have you been all my life? The instructor was incredibly knowledgeable and articulate. 
                This was the first time I have taken a class in a remote format, and I was delighted with it and look forward to coming back 
                to ONLC for more classes in the future. I loved the fact that even though I was in a class with other people, the actual 
                physical space was private and quiet and very conducive to learning! Thank you.</p>
